steps:
  - step: I have a "my_test.humane.yml" file with the content {yaml}
    yaml: |-
      test: Inner test

      steps:
        - I run 'echo "humane 🙂"'
        - stdout should contain "🙂"
  - I run "%humane_path%"
  - step: "stdout should contain 'Passing tests: 1'"
  - step: "stdout should contain 'Failing tests: 0'"
  - step: "stdout should contain 'All tests passed'"
  - stderr should be empty
  - step: I have a "my_test.humane.yml" file with the content {yaml}
    yaml: |-
      test: Inner test

      steps:
        - I run 'echo "humane 🙁"'
        - stdout should contain "🙂"
  - I run "%humane_path%" and expect it to fail
  - step: "stdout should contain 'Passing tests: 0'"
  - step: "stdout should contain 'Failing tests: 1'"
  - step: "stdout should contain 'Some tests failed'"
  - stderr should be empty
